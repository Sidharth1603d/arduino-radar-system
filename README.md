Real-time radar system using Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor for object detection and distance measurement.
#  Arduino Radar System

## Overview
The **Arduino Radar System** is a real-time object detection project that simulates the basic working principle of a radar. It uses an **ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor** to scan the surrounding area and measure the distance of detected objects.

This project demonstrates core concepts of **embedded systems**, **sensor interfacing**, and **real-time data processing**, making it suitable for robotics and automation applications.

## Objectives
- Design a low-cost embedded radar system
- Detect objects in real time
- Measure distance using ultrasonic sensing
- Implement servo-based angular scanning
- Display angle and distance information effectively

---

## Working Principle
1. The servo motor rotates from **0° to 180°**
2. At each angle, the ultrasonic sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse
3. The reflected echo is captured by the sensor
4. Distance is calculated using the **time-of-flight** method
5. Detected object distance and angle are displayed in real time
